======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Upon initial installation, the printer settings for the Citizen 9- and 24-pin
printers have the Color option selected. If the printer does not have Citizen's
color hardware installed, printing charts or text with color results in dark
output. There is no dithering as expected.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, open Control Panel, and select the Printers icon.
Choose the Setup button, and clear the Color check box. This dithers the colors
to produce the correct output.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setting the Intensity Control to as light as possible in the Setup dialog box
does not have the desired effect if the Color check box is still selected.


Additional query words: 3.1 3.10 Citizen color 3.11
