1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,613
- Ooh
- Oh no!

2
00:00:02,875 --> 00:00:03,840
- Uh oh!

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,475
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:06,308
- [Dad] Yeah!

5
00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:09,123
Brown, gray and yellow.

6
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:14,421
- I got pink!

7
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:15,959
My favorite color!

8
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:18,870
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,543
Today we're doing the
three marker challenge.

10
00:00:22,543 --> 00:00:25,126
(upbeat music)

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,170
- [Mom] Okay, who's ready?

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,003
- [Everyone] Me!

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,530
- This is our first drawing.

14
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,690
We have three minutes to draw
it with only three markers.

15
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,810
- [Dad] Alright Caleb,
pick your three markers.

16
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,180
(upbeat music)

17
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,793
Three.
- Ooh.

18
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:43,626
- [Dad] What do you got?

19
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,310
This is gonna be hard.

20
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,129
- [Dad] Okay, go ahead Elise.

21
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,130
(upbeat music)

22
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,178
Look at the three colors.

23
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:52,011
- [Elise] That's pretty good.

24
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:52,963
- [Mom] Those are pretty.

25
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:55,055
- I'm excited. (laughs)

26
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,325
(upbeat music)

27
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,613
Oh!

28
00:00:58,613 --> 00:00:59,446
- [Dad] Ooh, look at those colors.

29
00:00:59,446 --> 00:01:00,944
- [Caleb] You got good!

30
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:01,777
- One...

31
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:04,675
- [Caleb] What?!

32
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:06,206
- [Dad] Nice, good colors.

33
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:07,842
- [Mom] Alright, shall we see how it goes?

34
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:08,920
- [Everyone] Yes!

35
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,510
- [Dad] Alright, three
minutes are on the clock.

36
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,062
Ready, go.

37
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:14,895
(energetic music)

38
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,690
Isaac's taking advantage
of having a green.

39
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,625
Laura, I like your blue water.

40
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:23,458
(energetic music)

41
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:31,727
- My marker's going dead.

42
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:34,550
- [Dad] Well, just keep doing
the best you can with it.

43
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,530
So we initially gave
you guys three minutes,

44
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,120
but that's almost up.

45
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,754
So we're gonna give you a
couple more minutes, okay?

46
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:41,891
- [Everyone] Okay.

47
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:44,391
(funky music)

48
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,180
- [Dad] Does the fish have turquoise eyes?

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,870
So we're going to have
about one more minute.

50
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,850
Is that okay, everyone?

51
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,320
- Uh huh.
- Yeah, because I'm gonna

52
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,288
finish my fish tomorrow.

53
00:01:57,288 --> 00:01:58,121
- [Dad] Yeah.

54
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:00,100
If you can't finish now
you'll just do it tomorrow.

55
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,970
- I need yellow.

56
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,478
- [Dad] Did you grab a yellow?

57
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:03,311
- Nope.

58
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:04,263
- [Dad] Aw, man.

59
00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:05,407
- Can you give me a yellow?

60
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:08,949
- [Dad] No, you just get to use
these three that you picked.

61
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,420
It's hard, huh?

62
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,420
- Yes.

63
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,300
- [Dad] Alright everybody
finished their's up.

64
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,087
Here's Caleb's

65
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:16,330
and Elise

66
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,610
and Isaac

67
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,443
and Laura.

68
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,870
- Let us know in the poll
which one is your favorite.

69
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,420
- [Dad] Caleb, I think the
black was a hard color to have.

70
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,910
- Since I had a bit extra time,

71
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,205
I added some, like, makeup.

72
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:32,670
- [Dad] And you decided
not to do the water,

73
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,555
which worked out just
fine leaving it white.

74
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:35,388
- Yeah.

75
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,221
- [Dad] That looks really good,

76
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:37,140
and I like the makeup addition.

77
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,910
- I really liked my colors.

78
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,750
They were pretty easy to work with,

79
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,730
but I was going pretty
fast on the water and stuff

80
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,200
that I just decided I could
do the sky, the water,

81
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,213
and the snail.

82
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:52,613
- I liked my colors,
but I wish I got yellow.

83
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:54,650
- [Dad] Yeah, you wanted yellow.

84
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,656
That is hard, but to only use three.

85
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:58,606
- You did really well with those colors.

86
00:02:58,606 --> 00:03:02,427
I wouldn't be able to even
think of lipstick on mine.

87
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:04,270
- [Dad] Okay, who wants
to try another one?

88
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,860
- [Everyone] Me!

89
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,840
- [Dad] Alright.

90
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,367
- This is our next drawing.

91
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:09,328
- [Dad] Alright.

92
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:10,547
- It's kinda difficult.

93
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:11,380
- [Dad] Yep.

94
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,963
(peppy music)

95
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:16,530
(squeaking)

96
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,519
Alright, good colors.

97
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:19,842
- I got pink!

98
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:21,360
My favorite color!

99
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,860
(peppy music)

100
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:29,970
- Blue, battery charge blue,
that was one I got last time,

101
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,927
green.

102
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:33,420
(squeaking)

103
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,002
- Ooh
- Oh no!

104
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:37,112
(laughing)

105
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:38,400
- Uh oh!

106
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,102
It's actually a different yellow.

107
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:40,935
- [Dad] Is it?

108
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:42,810
They look exactly the same to me.

109
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,590
- No, this one's a little brighter.

110
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,090
(peppy music)

111
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:51,415
- Green, orange, and pink.

112
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,580
- [Dad] Okay.

113
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,410
- [Mom] These are gonna be
some funny-looking rainbows.

114
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,650
- [Dad] On your mark,

115
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,960
get set,

116
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,977
go!

117
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:01,902
And Elise begins with yellow.

118
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:03,160
(both laughing)

119
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,382
I really like how you're doing the tree.

120
00:04:05,382 --> 00:04:07,092
Looks good, buddy.

121
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:09,592
(peppy music)

122
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:15,299
That's a beautiful color, Laura.

123
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,834
- Thanks.

124
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:19,221
- [Dad] Janea just woke up from her nap.

125
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:20,054
- Ah!

126
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:21,495
- [Dad] Yeah.

127
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,836
Yeah those are fun.

128
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:23,669
- Oh.

129
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:27,964
- [Dad] Lisey had the two color challenge.

130
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:29,660
- (laughs) I'm done.

131
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,493
- [Dad] You're done?

132
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:31,326
- Yep.

133
00:04:31,326 --> 00:04:32,886
- [Dad] You finished
that in like a minute.

134
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:35,719
(energetic music)

135
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,060
- [Dad] Laura, I love it!

136
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,224
That's your name!

137
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:43,535
- I made thunder.

138
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:44,368
It's his eyes.

139
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,070
I just need connect them

140
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,794
which will make it look like thunder.

141
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:49,627
- Thunder! Boom boom!
- I should make some thunder.

142
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:53,310
- [Dad] Here's Laura's three colors.

143
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,133
And her finished project.

144
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,660
Isaac with the blue and the green.

145
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,573
Lisey with the two yellows.

146
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,030
And Caleb with the
orange, green, and pink.

147
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,824
So Lisey, how was that to
only really have two colors.

148
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:12,010
- Um, it was okay.

149
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,040
- [Dad] Laura, I love that you
added rain there at the end.

150
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,714
- I like how one cloud's
pink and one cloud's white.

151
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:19,170
- [Several Kids] Yeah.

152
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,562
- I like the yellow, and the green.

153
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:22,510
(dad laughs)

154
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,200
I like the light blue and the dark blue

155
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,650
enough together that I
didn't even add the green.

156
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,540
It looks nice.

157
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,231
- Let us know which one's your favorite.

158
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:35,148
- This is our next one!

159
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:38,110
(upbeat music)

160
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,420
- [Dad] Brown, gray, and yellow.

161
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,080
Not very exciting.

162
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,460
(upbeat music)

163
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,910
- [Dad] Yellow, black,
and a light mint green.

164
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,743
- That's really good.

165
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:51,760
- [Dad] Black is hard, because
what do you do with black?

166
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,730
It's a tough color.

167
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,393
- I'll just color it lightly on.

168
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,650
- Okay, this would be chocolate,

169
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,523
and these would be the sprinkles.

170
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,245
- [Dad] Good colors!

171
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:06,078
(laughing)

172
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:07,440
Blue, green, and pink.

173
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,842
- [Mom] You're the only one
who didn't get a dark color.

174
00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:12,675
(energetic music)

175
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:18,571
- First, my fav--

176
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:19,632
my two favorite colors.

177
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:21,590
Pink and green and blue.

178
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,423
(energetic music)

179
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,740
- [Dad] Your cherry has blue and green?

180
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,270
- And pink.

181
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,500
- [Dad] Obviously.

182
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,241
Laura your creativity is a lot of fun.

183
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:37,241
- I am done!

184
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:42,442
- [Dad] You keep finishing
way before everybody else.

185
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:43,275
(Elise groans)

186
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:45,650
(upbeat music)

187
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,150
(baby growls)

188
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,222
- [Dad] So what color are you
gonna color the ice cream?

189
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:52,370
- Nothing.

190
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,400
- [Dad] Just leave it white?

191
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,570
- [Caleb] Yeah.

192
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,590
- [Dad] Vanilla.

193
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,332
Instead of a cherry it's a green apple?

194
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:58,165
- [Caleb] Yeah.

195
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:00,280
- [Isaac] Okay, I'm done.

196
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,080
- [Caleb] You did good
with the gray, Isaac.

197
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,690
- [Dad] Laura, yours remind
me of a rainbow sno-cone.

198
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,920
Alright here's Caleb's,

199
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,860
Elise,

200
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,970
Isaac,

201
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,773
and Laura.

202
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,910
- In the poll, let us know
which one's your favorite.

203
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,770
- I love it!

204
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,828
- [Elise] I would like to eat that.

205
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:19,560
- I'm always gonna do pretty

206
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,590
drawings.
- Out of all these

207
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,621
I would want to eat this one.

208
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:25,181
- I'm gonna eat this one and that one.

209
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:26,519
- And that one and that one.

210
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,780
(upbeat music)

211
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,700
- [Everyone] Thanks for watching!

212
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,205
- Thank for watching!

213
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:35,413
- [Both] J House out.

214
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,246
(upbeat music)

215
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:38,122
- [Mom] Now we're headed
to an escape room.

216
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:39,810
(energetic music)

217
00:07:39,810 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Dad] He's going!
