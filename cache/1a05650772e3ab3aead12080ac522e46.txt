CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT
OF APPEALS OF
VIRGINIA
Syllabus

															1. Where the highest court of a State, confronted with the two
questions whether a state property tax is invalid under the state
taxing statutes and whether the property is immune under the
commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, prefers to rest its
judgment avoiding the assessment explicitly and exclusively on the
federal ground, the case is within the jurisdiction of this Court
under 28 U.S.C. ยง 344(b). P. 293 U. S.
16.

															2. Intangible property of a corporation consisting of money on
hand at the place of its principal office in the State that created
it and the excess of its bills and accounts receivable there over
its bills and accounts payable has its situs for property taxation
in that State. P. 293 U. S.
19.

															3. The facts that such intangible property is employed wholly in
interstate commerce and that the owner has no real or tangible
personal property in the State do not exempt the intangible
property from a nondiscriminatory property tax by the State. P.
293 U. S.
19.

															4. Cases in which state taxes on the privilege of doing an
interstate business were avoided as directly burdening interstate
commerce or touching property beyond the jurisdiction of the State
are inapplicable to a nondiscriminatory ad valorem tax on
property used in interstate commerce within the taxing
jurisdiction, for such property taxation affects interstate
commerce only incidentally. P. 293
U.S. 20.

															161 Va. 718, 736; 167 S.E. 268, 172 S.E. 927, reversed.

															Certiorari, 292 U.S. 619, to review a judgment avoiding a state
tax assessment for conflict with the commerce clause of the Federal
Constitution. The case arose upon the application of the taxpayer
to the state court of first instance for correction of the
assessment and exoneration from the tax. Judgment for the taxpayer
was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals on a writ of error
sued out by the State.

															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.

															The Imperial Coal Sales Company, a corporation organized under
the laws of Virginia, sought exoneration from taxes assessed on its
capital and income by the Department of Taxation of that state. The
taxes were assailed under the commerce clause and the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The judgment of
the trial court holding the taxes to be invalid was affirmed by the
Supreme Court of Appeals. 161 Va. 718, 736, 167 S.E. 268, 270, 172
S.E. 927. This Court granted certiorari. 292 U.S. 619.

															The tax on income was held to be invalid upon the nonfederal
ground that it was unauthorized by the state law. But, in dealing
with the capital tax, the state court concluded that it was
"unnecessary to pass upon the construction of ยง 73 of the Tax Code
under which the assessment was made." While observing "a strong
leaning and intent on the part of the lawmakers to exclude such
corporations as the sales company from state tax action," the court
did not put its decision upon a nonfederal ground, but based it
explicitly upon the ground that the tax was invalid under the
Federal Constitution. The court said:

															"We prefer to rest the decision of the validity of the capital
tax here considered upon the broad proposition that it is invalid
because it is a burden upon interstate commerce, and forbidden by
the Constitution of the United States."

															As the decision was thus expressly rested not upon the
inapplicability of the state law, but upon a determination of the
federal

															Page 293 U. S. 17

															question by which the bar of the Federal Constitution was
erected against the levy of the tax, this Court has jurisdiction.
28 U.S.C. 344(b); Henderson Bridge Co. v. Henderson City,
173 U. S. 592,
173 U. S.
608-609; Rogers v. Hennepin County,
240 U. S. 184,
240 U. S.
188-189; Grayson v. Harris, 267 U.
S. 352, 267 U. S.
358.

															The material facts, as set forth by the state court, are as
follows: respondent, having its principal office in Lynchburg, Va.
and maintaining a branch office in Cincinnati, Ohio, conducts a
sale agency. Its sole business is that of selling coal for foreign
coal mining corporations. It directs and manages the shipment and
transportation of the coal, collects the proceeds of sale, and is
paid a commission of eight percent. Respondent does not own or
lease coal mines, and is not engaged in the business of mining. No
coal of any consequence is sold in Virginia, and none of the coal
is located in Virginia at the time of sale. Nor does respondent own
or operate warehouses or coal storage yards in Virginia. It does
not retail, buy, or own coal, but sells coal for its foreign
principals in carload lots f.o.b. mines for a continuous journey
between points outside of Virginia. When coal is sold through the
Cincinnati office, contracts are forwarded to the Lynchburg office
for approval, and orders are sent to the mines for shipment. The
record of sales and an account with the mines from which the coal
is shipped are kept in the office at Lynchburg. Purchasers agree to
pay monthly. Respondent collects the money and deposits it in bank
in Lynchburg, and from these proceeds the mines are paid for the
coal, less respondent's commissions.

															The state court held that, while respondent was doing business
in Virginia, that business "arises out of, is inseparable from and
incidental only to, the principal business of selling coal in
interstate commerce." The court said that a corporation engaged in
interstate commerce

															Page 293 U. S. 18

															"may be taxed by a state on (1) its real estate and tangible
personal property situated in the taxing state, and (2) upon its
intangible personal property, if in the taxing state it does
intrastate business or has any appreciable real or tangible
property. But if it has no real or tangible property and does no
intrastate business in the taxing state, it cannot be taxed by that
state."

															1. The tax in question, styled a "capital tax," is an ad
valorem property tax. It is a state tax of "seventy-five cents
on every one hundred dollars of the actual value" of the capital of
any trade or business except that otherwise specifically taxed or
exempted from taxation. Section 73, Tax Code of Virginia. By
"capital" is meant the property described. The property which is
subject to the tax consists of (1) the inventory of stock on hand;
(2) the excess of all bills and accounts receivable over bills and
accounts payable; (3) all money on hand and on deposit, and (4) all
other taxable personal property of any kind whatever, including all
choses in action, equities, demands, and claims, but excluding
certain property specifically mentioned in the statute. Real estate
used in trade or business is not held to be capital under the
statute, but is to be listed and taxed as other real estate, and
tangible personal property used in trades and business mentioned in
the statute is to be listed exclusively for local taxation.

															In the instant case, no property was assessed under the first
and fourth categories of the statute, for respondent had none. The
assessment, as the state court found, was based "on the money on
hand, plus the excess of the bills and accounts receivable over the
bills and accounts payable." The state court treated the tax as a
property tax, saying that

															"it must be borne in mind that the tax sought to be imposed is
one upon property which is entirely intangible, and which is used
wholly and exclusively in interstate commerce. "

															Page 293 U. S. 19

															2. Respondent's ownership of the property assessed is not
disputed. No question is presented on this point merely because of
the conduct of its business as a sales agency. The ownership of the
property was the subject of a stipulation in the trial court, and
it was agreed "that the property constituting the basis of the
assessment on capital was, on the dates in question, the property
of the sales company."

															3. The money on hand, and the bills and accounts receivable, the
excess of which over bills and accounts payable was assessed, had
their situs in Virginia. Respondent is a domestic corporation with
its principal office in that state, where the proceeds of its
accounts receivable are collected and deposited in bank. Such
credits and accounts are regarded as situated at the domicile of
the creditor, and that domicile establishes a basis for taxation.

S. 276, 286 U. S.
279-280.

															4. Property having its situs within the taxing state is not
exempt from a nondiscriminatory property tax merely because the
property is used in interstate commerce. Corporations engaged in
interstate commerce should bear their property share of the burdens
of the government under whose protection they conduct their
operations, and nondiscriminatory taxation of their property,
although used in interstate commerce, as this Court has frequently
said, affects that commerce only incidentally, and is not
inconsistent with the constitutional immunity from the imposition
of direct burdens. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Adams,
155 U. S. 688,
155 U. S. 696;
Adams Express Co. v. Ohio, 165 U.
S. 194, 165 U. S. 220;
Atlantic & Pacific Telegraph Co. v. Philadelphia,
190 U. S. 160,
190 U. S. 163;
United
Page 293 U. S. 20
States Express Co. v. Minnesota, 223 U.
S. 335, 223 U. S. 344;
Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, 246 U.
S. 450, 246 U. S. 453;
Wells, Fargo & Co. v. Nevada, 248 U.
S. 165, 248 U. S.
166-167; Eastern Air Transport v. Tax
Commission, 285 U. S. 147,
285 U. S.
152.

															Such taxation may embrace intangible, as well as tangible,
property. Adams Express Co. v. Ohio, 166 U.
S. 185, 166 U. S.
218-219; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, supra;
Wells, Fargo & Co. v. Nevada, supra. It is not the
character of the property that makes it subject to such a tax, but
the facts that the property has its situs within the state, and
that the owner should give appropriate support to the government,
that protects it. That duty is not less when the property is
intangible than when it is tangible. Nor are we able to perceive
any sound reason for holding that the owner must have real estate
or tangible property within the state in order to subject its
intangible property within the state to taxation.

															We are dealing, as we have said, with an ad valorem
property tax, and not with a privilege tax. Respondent is not taxed
upon the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce, and
decisions, cited by the state court, holding such taxes to be
invalid are not apposite. Thus, in Ozark Pipe Line Corp. v.
Monier, 266 U. S. 555, the
tax was held to be bad as one imposed "upon the privilege or right
to do business" of a corporation engaged only in interstate
commerce. Id., p. 
266 U. S. 562. The same principle of protection was
applicable in Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts,
268 U. S. 203,
268 U. S. 216.
Compare Anglo-Chilean Corp. v. Alabama, 288 U.
S. 218. Decisions holding invalid license fees or excise
taxes measured in such a manner as to burden interstate commerce
and to attempt to exert the taxing authority with respect to
business and property beyond the jurisdiction of the state are also
inapplicable. Cf. Air-Way Corp. v. Day, 266 U. S.
71, 266 U. S. 83.
Nor are we here concerned

															Page 293 U. S. 21

															with the question which has been discussed in cases dealing with
the effect of the taxation of gross receipts derived from
interstate commerce. * Without going
into that question, it is sufficient again to point out that the
tax is not laid upon gross receipts, but upon the "excess of all
bills and accounts receivable over bills and accounts payable." The
effect upon interstate commerce, as in other instances of
nondiscriminatory property taxation, is, at most, indirect and
incidental. See United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek,
247 U. S. 321,
247 U. S. 329;
Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U. S. 37,
252 U. S.
57.

															The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

															Reversed.
