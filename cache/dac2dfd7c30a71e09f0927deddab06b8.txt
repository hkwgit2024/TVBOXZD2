let's not talk about injuries at QB, due to being hit a ton.
Want to see what OB can do with a good QB and decent to good OL play?
Watch NE when he was the OC.
They still run the same system, pretty much same as ours.
But, until the OL protection is good, you can be sure we won't see that type of play
Why would martim even be considered as a tackle? We drafted him to play on the interior of the o line, center to be exact... I don't get it
Mancz came in because Martin was hurt and did a fantastic job.
Just my opinion that Martin should be tried out at RT.
I'm with Malex on this one. I also think Martin will take over the center position......
Mancz will shift to RG.
I have no clue what we are doing at RT.
Yeah .... no kidding. Seems custom made for a Ramczyk type!
We can't honestly or accurately evaluate any of our QBs, RBs, WRs, or TEs until our offensive line is solidified.
that may never happen now that we've gone back to building our OL with 4th through 7th rounders.
I don't understand why you call TS mediocre. His problems have been physical, but when on the field, he has been very good.
I grew up watching the Cowboys and I like Tom Landry's attitude about players.
He said, "get me athletes and I'll make them football players." We need a little more of that and less GM wantabes at the HC position.
I think OB and Smith are not butting heads as much as most on this board think.
If Giacomini is healthy...then his veteran presence could be valuable at RT.
I would have him Davenport attached at the hip in all hopes that by the time the team hits the Bye Week, Davenport would be ready for heavy rotational duty.
